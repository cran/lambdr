extract_event_headers(event)
}
\arguments{
\item{event}{the response received from querying the next invocation
endpoint.}

\description{
This function is largely equivalent to \code{\link[httr]{headers}}, which it
wraps. The only difference is that the names of the headers returned are
converted to lower-case (these are meant to be case-insensitive) and the
headers are logged at the DEBUG level.
